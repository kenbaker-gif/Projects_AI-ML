# Email Spam Detection Using Logistic Regression

This project demonstrates the use of **Logistic Regression** for **spam detection** in emails. The goal is to classify emails as either **spam** or **not spam** based on their content.

## Skills Showcased

- **Logistic Regression**: Implemented a logistic regression model to classify emails as spam or not spam.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and processed the email dataset, including removing unnecessary characters and transforming the data into numerical features.
- **Feature Extraction**: Utilized techniques like **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** to convert email text into numerical vectors for model input.
- **Model Training**: Trained the logistic regression model using **gradient descent** (manual implementation) or **Scikit-learn** (linear approach).
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated the performance of the model using metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, and **recall** to assess its effectiveness in predicting spam.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Main programming language for the project.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing logistic regression and data vectorization.
- **Numpy**: For numerical computations in manual logistic regression implementation.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.

# Results
With the **maual implementation** I got an accuracy 0f **90.01%** and with the **Linear model** I got **92.03%**
